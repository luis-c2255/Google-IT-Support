# Week 1: Introduction to IT Support

## What is IT?
- **IT** is "the use of digital technology, like computers and the Internet, to store and process data into useful information."

- The IT industry refers to the entire scope all jobs and resources related to computing technologies in society. From network engineers, to hardware tech, to desktop support personnel.

- The heart and soul of IT support is helping people.

- IT helps people solve meaningful problems by using technology.

- IT skills have become necessary for day-to-day living.

- The Digital Divide refers to the digital literacy skill gap.
  - Pew Research Center: [Digital Divide](https://www.pewresearch.org/topics/digital-divide/)

### What does an IT Support Specialist do?

- There's really no such thing as "day-to-day work."

- Managing, installing, maintaining, troubleshooting, and configuring office and computing equipment.

- "Failure as a feedback" to be better-equipped to tackle those problems next time around.

### History of Computing

#### What is a computer?
A **computer** is a device that stores and processes data by performing calculations.

#### QWERTY layout

#### IT Pioneers
- [Charles Babbage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSAXbsbiid0)
- [Ada Lovelace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sB5ieSGGDmk)

#### What is an algorithm?
An **algorithm** is a series of steps that solve specific problems.

## The Path to Modern Computers

### What is cryptography?
**Cryptography** is the art of writing and solving codes. It evolved into a modern science in World War 2.

<!-- - Alan Turing and the Enigma Machine, ENIAC -->

### What does "open source" software mean?
**Open source** means anyone could modify and share it.

## Digital Logic


### Computer Language
*What a computer calculates, and how.*

#### What is binary?
**Binary system** is the communication that a computer uses (also known as a base-2 numeral system).

- We group binary into 8 numbers, or **bits** (Technically, a **bit** is a binary digit.)
  - A group of 8 bits is referred to as a **byte**.

- 256 possible values
  - 255 possible *decimal* values (0-255)

### Character Encoding
- **Character Encoding** Assigns our binary values to characters, so that we as humans can read them.

- [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) was the breakthrough standard, early on.
  - Bonus: [ASCII Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art)

- [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) replaced ASCII because it can store a character in more than one byte.

- The unicode standard helps us represent character encoding in a consistent manner.

- RGB model


### Binary

- The key concept behind binary is "on and off."

- Computer punch card holes represent the number 1

- Transistors voltage =1, no voltage =0

#### Supplemental Binary Reading
- [Wonderopolis: How Does the Binary System Work?](https://wonderopolis.org/wonder/how-does-the-binary-system-work)
- [BBC: Introducing Binary](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zwsbwmn/revision/1)
- [How to Geek: What is Binary, and Why Do Computers Use It?](https://www.howtogeek.com/367621/what-is-binary-and-why-do-computers-use-it/)

#### What are logic gates?
**Logic gates** allow our transistors to do more complex tasks, like decide where to send electrical signals depending on logical conditions.


## Computer Architecture Layer

### Abstraction

#### What is abstraction?
**Abstraction** is to take a relatively complex system and simplify it for our use.

### Computer Architecture Overview

#### The 4 Layers of Computers
1. Hardware
  - The **hardware layer** is made up of the physical components of a computer
2. Operating System
  - The **operating system** allows hardware to communicate with the system.
3. Software
  - The **software layer** is how we as humans interact with our computers.
4. Users
  - The **user** interacts with the computer; and can operate, maintain, and even program the computer.
